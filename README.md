# Basic Document NLP

The purpose of this project is to benchmark basic NLP techniques when it comes to the task of document classification.
In many cases, these documents will have been generated through OCR, in which case extra work would need to be done to 
correct OCR-specific errors.

**NOTE**: This project is just getting started.
